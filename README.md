## :page_facing_up: About
- The game: it is probably the most simple game, with 2 players, playing in turn. Who marks 3 consecutive boxes in line wins the game, if no one makes it , there will be a tie!
## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- Make a 3x3-box grid first
- Set up 2 players on the second step
- Make sure the play logic is correct. The trick is that whoever makes the 3 consecutive boxes in line wins.
- Notice there is a tie rule.
- Make a stop when the players win.
- Set up the 'restart'which must be linked to the action 'win'
## :rocket: Cool tech
- Animations: when the winner wins or there is a tie, it appeaars the lager image.
- Placeholder: display the mark for next player


## :white_check_mark: Future features
Next time ,I probably put more focus on CSS to make better and user friendly UI.
